	 	<h2> 🍏 Food 🍎 </h2>
		<p>There's not much else to say other than the fact I love food. Some of my favorite types of food are Japanese, Italian, Thai, Chinese, Middle-Eastern, the list goes on. I would definitely be able to recommend some good restaurants ;) </p>

		<h2> 🏄‍♀️ Sports 🤸‍♀️ </h2>
		<p>I have always been quite an active person, and I enjoy a variety of sports. Ever since I was little I have loved horses, and on days where I have time I like to play Polo. Another sport I have enjoyed for several years is wakeboarding. It is so exciting and I would recommend it to everyone.</p>

		<h2>✈️ Traveling 🌎</h2>
		<p>Ever since I was little I loved traveling. I love the feeling of the airport and being in an airplane. I enjoy discovering new places and meeting new people. I am also quite a foodie, so I enjoy trying all sorts of new cuisines. I would love to travel to more countries in the future.</p>
